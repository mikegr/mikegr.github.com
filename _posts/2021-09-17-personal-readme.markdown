This document is based on the idea from  https://managerreadme.com/

# Motivation for this document
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer these questions: Why did you take the time to write this document?"  
[//]: # "What were you aiming to get from others reading it?"

This document should show what I value in software development. 
It should show my understanding of agile project management. 
Transparency about a persons values can give a lot of hints and can be a discussion starter. 

# My role
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer these questions: How are you being measured for by the organization?"
[//]: # "What are the team's KPIs? How will you help your teammates get better at their jobs?"

As a chapter lead in George I'm not the line manager of the Android developers. 
My responsibility is the stability and maintainability of the Android app and to guide the Android chapter including release management.
As part of the platform guild I give input regarding the system architecture.
A chapter lead in George is responsible for process and the "How", the hiring process and on-boarding of new developers.
There should be consistent development quality across teams.
I'm the contact person for Android-related questions that can't be solved in a squad or are not related to a domain of a team. 


# What do I value most?
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer these questions: What does helping me look like?"
[//]: # "What is my process for handling conflicts? (and how you can do it yourself) How does helping me look like?"
[//]: # "What weaknesses of mine should the team know about, and how can they help me improve?"

Decisions within the Android chapter should be handled by the chapter itself and done in consent. 
Only in disputes I make a decision usually based on the majority opinion.  
Decisions are done based on the following questions:
* Which process do we follow to work together on a common app? 
* Which libraries and guidelines do we use?

# My Expectations
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer these questions: How should people set time with you?"
[//]: # "When it comes to mistakes, what's the best way for employees to come forward? How do you define 'Done'?"
[//]: # "When should people be available and how? (e.g. work hours, availability via chat/phone etc.)"

Developers should join the weekly chapter meeting and off-sites.
They should spend time to review other developers code in a ratio to their own pull requests. 

# 1:1s
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer these questions: When do you usually have 1:1s with your team?"
[//]: # "Who should lead the 1:1 (you or them)? What should be the main focus during that time?"

My 1:1s focuses on the well-being of developers within the organization. 
They should have the opportunity to develop themselves and be in a zone without being constantly stressed and be bored.   
The question about what to do has to be answered within a team.  
I'm there if there is a dispute in how to solve issues on Android. 
I'm there if there is a dispute between Android developers.
  
# Personality quirks
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer this question: What are the individual quirks that anyone working with me should know about?"
[//]: # "Usually, these quirks are not 'good' or 'bad', they just part of who you are."
[//]: # "It's the small things that people do that gets you extremely happy/excited or extremely upset/nervous within 5 seconds without any good reason."

I'm introvert and I like to work focused in a quiet space.
I prefer to talk with people in person and try to avoid telephone. 

# Where to focus on your first 90 days?
[//]: # "[DELETE LATER]"
[//]: # "Try to answer these questions: What does effective onboarding look like on your team?" 
[//]: # "How can they tell if they're doing a good job in their first 30 days?"

A new developer should have got a good overview about the applied software practices within the chapter. 
She should have completed their onboarding tasks which is not only about development but also about the environment and 
the surrounding domains.
